Provides integration of a client system with the
FreeIPA infrastructure — a centralized solution for identity, authentication (including SSO and 2FA),
and authorization management.
The component includes tools for enrolling the host into an IPA domain, configuring access control,
handling certificates automatically, and supporting SUDO.

If your network uses IPA for authentication, this component should be installed on every client machine.
