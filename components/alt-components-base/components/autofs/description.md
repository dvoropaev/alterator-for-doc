A tool for automatically mounting and unmounting filesystems

Autofs controls the operation of the automount daemons.  The automount daemons
automatically mount filesystems when you use them and unmount them after a
period of inactivity.  Filesystems can include network filesystems, CD-ROMs,
floppies and others.
