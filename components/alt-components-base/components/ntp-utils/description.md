Provides a set of utilities for configuring and monitoring the NTP (Network Time Protocol) service.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time
of a computer client or server to another server or reference time
source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides
client accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs and up to
a few tens of milliseconds on WANs.
