Contains the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon responsible for synchronizing the system time of a computer with external accurate time sources.
Provides high-precision time synchronization in both local and wide-area networks.
NTP achieves synchronization accuracy up to milliseconds in local area networks (LAN) and up to several tens of milliseconds in wide area networks (WAN).
