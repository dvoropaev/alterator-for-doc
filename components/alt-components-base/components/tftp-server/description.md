Provides a server implementation of the TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) â€”
a simple file transfer protocol commonly used for booting diskless workstations and network devices.
The component includes both standalone implementations and xinetd-based startup scripts.
It offers basic file transfer capabilities between remote systems but is not intended for use in untrusted
or public environments due to the lack of authentication and encryption mechanisms.
