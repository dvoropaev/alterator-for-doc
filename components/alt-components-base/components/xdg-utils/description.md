a variety of desktop integration tasks. About half of the tools focus on
tasks commonly required during the installation of a desktop application
and the other half focuses on integration with the desktop environment
while the application is running. Even if the desktop components of your
application are limited to an installer, configuration or management tool,
Xdg-utils provides you with an easy way to enhance the usage experience
of your customers by improving the integration of these components in
the user's environment.
