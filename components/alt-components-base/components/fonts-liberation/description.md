The Liberation font family provides free alternatives to Microsoft's proprietary fonts:
Liberation Serif (equivalent to Times New Roman), Liberation Sans (equivalent to Arial), and Liberation Mono (equivalent to Courier New).

These fonts are metrically compatible with their originals, ensuring proper document display without layout changes.
They are distributed under the open-source SIL Open Font License (OFL).
