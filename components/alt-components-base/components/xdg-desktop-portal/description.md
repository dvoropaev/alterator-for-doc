(e.g., Flatpak) and the host system.

The component includes:

* xdg-desktop-portal — the main portal service.
* xdg-desktop-portal-gnome — the XDG Desktop Portal implementation for GNOME. Uses GNOME-specific APIs and components.
* xdg-desktop-portal-gtk — a backend implementation for xdg-desktop-portal that uses GTK+ and various GNOME infrastructure components.
