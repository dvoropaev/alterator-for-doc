Provides the Alterator module “Network Installation Server”,
which allows you to configure sources (disk images) for operating system installations over the network.

The module offers the following features:

* selecting an installation disk image from the list of available images
* adding and removing installation disk images.
When adding an image, you can either choose an existing ISO image or read it directly from a CD or DVD
* using remote access to the target computer (via the VNC protocol) during the OS installation process
