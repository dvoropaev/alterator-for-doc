Poptop daemon for Linux implementing the server side of the PPTP
(Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), allowing the creation of VPN servers
compatible with Microsoft clients. It manages tunneled PPP connections by
encapsulating traffic using GRE, and also supports IP address management
and additional security configurations.
