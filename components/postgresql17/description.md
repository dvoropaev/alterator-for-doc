PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs,
including transactions, subqueries, and user-defined types and functions.

The component includes the server part and additional modules (contrib) distributed with PostgreSQL.
It is intended for creating, running, and maintaining your own PostgreSQL databases.
