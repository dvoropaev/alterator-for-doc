Provides tools for interacting with Linux kernel's connection tracking system,
enabling state synchronization for high-availability firewalls and advanced
connection flow management. Includes **conntrack** (CLI for querying/editing
connection tables) and **conntrackd** (daemon for real-time state synchronization
between cluster nodes). Supports stateful firewall failover, connection statistics,
and event monitoring via Netfilter's conntrack subsystem.
