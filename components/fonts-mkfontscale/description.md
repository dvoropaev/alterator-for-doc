mkfontscale is a utility for generating an index of scalable fonts for the X Window System.

For each specified directory, mkfontscale scans all scalable font files, generates an X11 font name (XLFD) for each file,
and writes the result along with the file name to a fonts.scale file in the same directory.

The utility is distributed under the MIT/X11 License.
