DRM (Direct Rendering Modules) is a set of kernel modules that provide direct access to graphics hardware through the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).

The Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) is a framework that allows safe and efficient direct access to graphics hardware.
It involves modifications to the X server, several client libraries, and the operating system kernel.
The primary use of DRI is to enable fast OpenGL rendering.

This component includes:

* kernel-modules-drm — core DRI modules

* kernel-modules-drm-nouveau — DRI modules intended for use with NVIDIA graphics cards
