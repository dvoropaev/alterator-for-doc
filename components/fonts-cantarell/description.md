Cantarell is a modern sans-serif typeface family designed specifically for comfortable on-screen reading.
The fonts feature clean, humanist letterforms and are well-suited for user interfaces and web design. Originally created as a student project,
Cantarell was later adopted as the default typeface in the GNOME desktop environment and has since been developed as an open-source project.
