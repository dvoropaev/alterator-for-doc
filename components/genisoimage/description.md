A command line utility to create an ISO9660/Joliet/HFS filesystem.

The genisoimage program is used as a pre-mastering program; i.e.,
it generates the ISO9660 filesystem.  genisoimage takes a snapshot of
a given directory tree and generates a binary image of the tree which
will correspond to an ISO9660 filesystem when written to a block device.
genisoimage is used for writing CD-ROMs, and includes support for
creating bootable El Torito CD-ROMs.
