# ALT Education product (edition)

ALT Education OS is an easy-to-install and convenient-to-use operating system designed for everyday use in planning, organizing, and conducting the educational process in institutions of various levels. The system is distinguished by its accessibility, reliability, functionality, and low hardware resource requirements.

The ALT Education project is a user-friendly Linux operating system. "User-friendly" here refers to the circle of personal computer users who do not possess intricate system configuration and usage skills. The idea behind the ALT Education project is to foster a sustained interest in free software by demonstrating its convenience, practicality, and effectiveness in the educational environment.

ALT Education includes over 30 fully Russified programs, which are specialized tools for information support of the educational process. These programs are designed to solve key educational tasks: from preparing teaching materials to facilitating interaction between teachers and students. The package also includes modern educational resources: subject-oriented environments, simulators, and learning systems.

One of the key features of the product is the integration of teachers' and students' workstations. Based on ALT Education, it is possible to build a modern, flexible, and secure infrastructure for providing educational materials and organizing interaction using a wide variety of devices — desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, tablets, and e-books.
