Domain client diagnostic tool.

diag-domain-client includes a set of checks and tests that help determine whether the computer is properly configured to operate within a domain,
and verify access to all necessary domain resources.

The tool has a modular structure. Modules can be invoked either all at once or individually. The utility allows logging the results to a log file.

The diagnostic process depends on whether the computer is currently joined to a domain. Some checks require superuser privileges.
A valid Kerberos ticket for a domain user is required for correct operation.
