Provides automatic switching of USB devices from storage emulation mode to their operational mode (e.g., modem or network interface).
Used for proper initialization of multi-mode USB devices, such as 3G/4G modems, especially during their first connection.
Integrates with the udev subsystem and operates without user intervention, while also supporting manual execution for non-standard devices.
