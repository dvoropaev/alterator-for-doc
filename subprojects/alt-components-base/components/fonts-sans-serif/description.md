Carlito is a sans-serif font metrically compatible with the Calibri font.
It is designed to serve as a full replacement for Calibri without causing text shifting or line wrapping issues.
Carlito is based on the Lato font and includes four main styles: regular, bold, italic, and bold italic.

The font covers Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (not completely) and contains about 2,000 glyphs, matching Calibriâ€™s character coverage.

Carlito is distributed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL), version 1.1.
