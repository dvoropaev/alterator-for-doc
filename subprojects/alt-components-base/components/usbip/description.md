The USB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB device sharing system over IP network.

To share USB devices between computers with their full functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB requests" into IP packets and
transmits them between computers.

Original USB device drivers and applications can be also used for remote USB devices without any
modification of them.

A computer can use remote USB devices as if they were directly attached; for example, we can:

* USB storage devices: fdisk, mkfs, mount/umount, file operations, play a DVD movie and record a DVD-R media.
* USB keyboards and USB mice: use with linux console and X Window System.
* USB webcams and USB speakers: view webcam, capture image data and play some music.
* USB printers, USB scanners, USB serial converters and USB Ethernet interfaces: ok, use fine.
