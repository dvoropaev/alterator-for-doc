Designed to configure restrictions on the use of USB devices.
The module operates on the basis of USBGuard functionality,
allows you to maintain black and white lists of restrictions and provides two types of actions - allow/block.

The module provides the following features:

* scanning of connected devices;
* selecting and adding devices to the rule set from the list of connected devices;
* creating predefined rules for common scenarios;
* creating rules based on interface descriptors: CC:SS:PP;
* creating rules based on USB device properties: PID, VID;
* creating rules based on device hash (PID+VID+SN);
* creating complex rules with additional conditions;
* importing rules from a CSV file;
* editing values in created rules;
* viewing the log of USB device connection/disconnection events.
