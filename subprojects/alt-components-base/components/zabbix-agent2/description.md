Zabbix agent 2 is a new generation of Zabbix agent, written in Go (with some C code reused from Zabbix agent). It is designed to:

* Reduce the number of TCP connections
* Provide improved concurrency of checks
* Be easily extendable with plugins, which provide simple checks with minimal code and support complex checks consisting of long-running scripts
and standalone data gathering with periodic reporting
* Function as a replacement for Zabbix agent, supporting all previous features
