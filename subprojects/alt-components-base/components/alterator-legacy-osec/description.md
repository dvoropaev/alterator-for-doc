System integrity control Alterator module.

The module is designed to perform the following operations:

* selection of filesystem objects to be verified;
* configuration of periodic integrity checks;
* setup of reporting modes for performed checks;
* monitoring of verification progress;
* on-demand verification initiation;
* retrieval of verification results.

Timely execution of these checks enables early detection of potentially harmful system modifications.
