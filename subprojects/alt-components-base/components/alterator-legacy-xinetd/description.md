Provides the Alterator module "xinetd Services", designed for configuring xinetd-managed services.

Xinetd (Extended Internet Service Daemon) listens for incoming connections on specified ports and launches the appropriate services.
Unlike traditional servers that start at system boot and remain idle while waiting for requests, xinetd runs as a single process,
thus conserving system resources.
