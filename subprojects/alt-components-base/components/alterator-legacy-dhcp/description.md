Provides the Alterator module "DHCP Server", designed for configuring a DHCP server.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol that allows clients to automatically obtain an IP address from a reserved address range,
as well as additional local network information (such as the network DNS server, search domain, and default gateway).

The alterator-dhcp module allows you to:

* enable or disable the DHCP service
* specify which network interfaces are served by the DHCP server
* define the starting and ending IP addresses
* set the lease duration for IP addresses
* specify the DNS server and default gateway
* reserve IP addresses for specific devices
* view a list of assigned IP addresses
