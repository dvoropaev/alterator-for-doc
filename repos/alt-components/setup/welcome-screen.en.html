<h2>ALT Components</h2>

<p>
    This application is designed to manage system components. Using components
    allows you to work with functional subsystems without having to search for
    individual packages yourself.
</p>

<p>
    You can search through components in a tree on the left. Mark or unmark
    components you want to install or uninstall and click "Apply".
